Task A: Medication Reminder Scheduler (Stub)

Implement a scheduler that generates medication reminders under user-defined constraints.

Inputs include:
  (i)  a list of medications with frequencies and permissible time windows,
  (ii) user quiet hours during which notifications must not occur,
  (iii) a maximum notification rate (no more than k reminders per hour),
  (iv) an optional snooze operation that shifts a reminder while preserving constraints.

The scheduler outputs the next N reminders in chronological order and must behave
deterministically under ties.

Edge cases to handle include:
  - reminders falling within quiet hours (requiring rescheduling),
  - collisions between reminders,
  - snoozes that violate constraints,
  - infeasible scheduling situations.

See the lab handout for full requirements.
